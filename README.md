# Syntax-Compiler
This is a end of year project form 2020-2021, which is a syntax compiler for our pseudo language 'Amarilla'.
The project was realized with Java.
In this project you can find two Amarilla files (.mrl), one with good syntax and the other with a bad one, so you can test them with our syntax compiler.
